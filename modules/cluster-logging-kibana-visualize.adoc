= Installing the Kibana Visualize tool

Kibana's *Visualize* tab enables you to create visualizations and dashboards for
monitoring container logs, allowing administrator users (`cluster-admin` or
`cluster-reader`) to view logs by deployment, namespace, pod, and container.

.Procedure

To load dashboards and other Kibana UI objects: 

. If necessary, get the Kibana route, which is created by default upon installation
of the Cluster Logging Operator:
+
----
$ oc get routes -n openshift-logging

NAMESPACE                  NAME                       HOST/PORT                                                            PATH     SERVICES                   PORT    TERMINATION          WILDCARD
openshift-logging          kibana                     kibana-openshift-logging.apps.openshift.com                                   kibana                     <all>   reencrypt/Redirect   None
----

. Get the name of your Elasticsearch pods.
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=elasticsearch

NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
elasticsearch-cdm-5ceex6ts-1-dcd6c4c7c-jpw6k    2/2     Running   0          22h
elasticsearch-cdm-5ceex6ts-2-f799564cb-l9mj7    2/2     Running   0          22h
elasticsearch-cdm-5ceex6ts-3-585968dc68-k7kjr   2/2     Running   0          22h
----

. Create the necessary per-user configuration that this procedure requires: 
  
.. Log in to  the Kibana dashboard as the user you want to add the dashboards to. 
+
----
https://kibana-openshift-logging.apps.openshift.com <1>
----
<1> Where the URL is Kibana route.

.. If the *Authorize Access* page appears, select all permissions and click *Allow selected permissions*.

.. Log out of the Kibana dashboard.
 
. Run the following command from the project where the pod is located using the 
name of any of your Elastiscearch pods:
+
----
$ oc exec <es-pod> -- es_load_kibana_ui_objects <user-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc exec elasticsearch-cdm-5ceex6ts-1-dcd6c4c7c-jpw6k -- es_load_kibana_ui_objects <user-name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The metadata of the kibana objects like visualizations, dashboards etc are stored in elasticsearch with the index format .kibana.{user_hash} where user_hash can be obtained by the command - userhash=$(echo -n $username | sha1sum | awk '{print $1}')
If share_ops are used, all users with cluster admin roles share the index and this metadata of the kibana objects is saved to .kibana index.

Any custom dashboard can be imported for a particular user either by using the import/export feature or by inserting the metadata on to the elasticsearch index using the curl command.
